Consider the array nums = [-3, 2, -3, 4, 2], which represents elevation changes along a hiking trail. To ensure that your energy level never falls below 1, you need to find the smallest positive starting energy level. In this example, if you start with an energy level of 5: Start at 5 Step 1: 5 + (-3) = 2 Step 2: 2 + 2 = 4 Step 3: 4 + (-3) = 1 Step 4: 1 + 4 = 5 Step 5: 5 + 2 = 7 With a starting energy level of 5, your energy never drops below 1 at any step. If the array is nums = [1, 2, 3], the minimum starting energy level is 1, as the elevation changes are all positive and your energy level will always stay above 1.
Find the minimum positive startValue such that your energy level never drops below 1 during your journey.

Q2
User
There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers colors. The color of tile i is represented by colors[i]:

colors[i] == 0 means that tile i is red.
colors[i] == 1 means that tile i is blue.
Every 3 contiguous tiles in the circle with alternating colors (the middle tile has a different color from its left and right tiles) is called an alternating group.

Return the number of alternating groups.

Note that since colors represents a circle, the first and the last tiles are considered to be next to each other.

 

Example 1:

Input: colors = [1,1,1]

Output: 0

Explanation:



Example 2:

Input: colors = [0,1,0,0,1]

Output: 3 c++ code

Sure! Here's the C++ code to solve this problem:

cpp
Copy code
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int countAlternatingGroups(const vector<int>& colors) {
    int n = colors.size();
    int count = 0;
    
    // Check for alternating groups in the array considering it as a circle
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (colors[i] != colors[(i + 1) % n] && colors[(i + 1) % n] != colors[(i + 2) % n]) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> colors1 = {1, 1, 1};
    vector<int> colors2 = {0, 1, 0, 0, 1};
    
    // Test case 1
    int result1 = countAlternatingGroups(colors1);
    // Output: 0
    cout << "Test Case 1 Result: " << result1 << endl;
    
    // Test case 2
    int result2 = countAlternatingGroups(colors2);
    // Output: 3
    cout << "Test Case 2 Result: " << result2 << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explain
Explanation:

The function countAlternatingGroups takes a vector of integers representing the colors of the tiles.
It iterates through each tile and checks if it forms an alternating group with the next two tiles, considering the circular nature of the array using the modulo operator.
If a group is found where the middle tile has a different color from its left and right tiles, it increments the count.
The main function tests the code with the provided example cases.

Sure! Here's an alternative logic and its implementation in C++:

This approach involves a single pass through the array while keeping track of potential alternating groups. We ensure that we correctly account for the circular nature of the array by checking the edges explicitly.

Initialization: Start by initializing a counter for the alternating groups.
Iterate through the array: Check each triplet in the array.
Handle Circular Case: Specifically handle the circular case by manually checking the first and last few elements.
Count Valid Groups: Increase the count if the current triplet forms an alternating group.
Here's the C++ code for this logic:

cpp
Copy code
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int countAlternatingGroups(const vector<int>& colors) {
    int n = colors.size();
    int count = 0;
    
    // Check each triplet in the array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int left = colors[i];
        int middle = colors[(i + 1) % n];
        int right = colors[(i + 2) % n];
        
        if (left != middle && middle != right && left != right) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> colors1 = {1, 1, 1};
    vector<int> colors2 = {0, 1, 0, 0, 1};
    
    // Test case 1
    int result1 = countAlternatingGroups(colors1);
    // Output: 0
    cout << "Test Case 1 Result: " << result1 << endl;
    
    // Test case 2
    int result2 = countAlternatingGroups(colors2);
    // Output: 3
    cout << "Test Case 2 Result: " << result2 << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explain
Explanation:
Initialization: We initialize the variable count to 0, which will keep track of the number of alternating groups.

Iterate through the array: We use a loop to iterate through each possible starting point of a triplet in the array. For each triplet starting at index i, we determine the values of the left, middle, and right tiles:

left = colors[i]
middle = colors[(i + 1) % n]
right = colors[(i + 2) % n]
Check for Alternating Group: For each triplet, we check if it forms an alternating group by ensuring all three tiles are different:

left != middle
middle != right
left != right
Count Valid Groups: If the triplet forms an alternating group, we increment the count.

This approach ensures that we correctly handle the circular nature of the array by using the modulo operator to wrap around the indices.

Sure! Here's another logic and its implementation in C++:

This approach involves checking each triplet in the array for alternating groups, but it uses an optimized method that only checks the alternating condition once per triplet and ensures that no overlapping groups are counted.

Alternative Logic:
Initialization: Start by initializing a counter for the alternating groups.
Iterate through the array: Check each triplet in the array.
Ensure Non-overlapping: Move to the next potential group only if an alternating group is found.

        // Check the current triplet for alternating condition
        if (colors[i] != colors[(i + 1) % n] && colors[(i + 1) % n] != colors[(i + 2) % n] && colors[i] != colors[(i + 2) % n]) {
            count++;
        }

    // Test case 1
    int result1 = countAlternatingGroups(colors1);
    // Output: 0
    cout << "Test Case 1 Result: " << result1 << endl;

    // Test case 2
    int result2 = countAlternatingGroups(colors2);
    // Output: 3
    cout << "Test Case 2 Result: " << result2 << endl;

    return 0;
}
Explain
Explanation:
Initialization: We initialize a counter count to keep track of the number of alternating groups.

Iterate through the array: We loop through each element in the array, treating it as the potential starting point of a triplet.

Check for Alternating Group: For each triplet starting at index i, we check if the left, middle, and right tiles form an alternating group:

left = colors[i]
middle = colors[(i + 1) % n]
right = colors[(i + 2) % n]
Count Valid Groups: If the triplet forms an alternating group (i.e., all three tiles are different), we increment the count.

This method also considers the circular nature of the array by using the modulo operator to wrap around the indices. The difference here is that this approach still checks each triplet but ensures that each potential group is evaluated independently.

You are given an integer array enemyEnergies denoting the energy values of various enemies.

You are also given an integer currentEnergy denoting the amount of energy you have initially.

You start with 0 points, and all the enemies are unmarked initially.

You can perform either of the following operations zero or multiple times to gain points:

Choose an unmarked enemy, i, such that currentEnergy >= enemyEnergies[i]. By choosing this option:
You gain 1 point.
Your energy is reduced by the enemy's energy, i.e. currentEnergy = currentEnergy - enemyEnergies[i].
If you have at least 1 point, you can choose an unmarked enemy, i. By choosing this option:
Your energy increases by the enemy's energy, i.e. currentEnergy = currentEnergy + enemyEnergies[i].
The enemy i is marked.
Return an integer denoting the maximum points you can get in the end by optimally performing operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: enemyEnergies = [3,2,2], currentEnergy = 2

Output: 3

Explanation:

The following operations can be performed to get 3 points, which is the maximum:

First operation on enemy 1: points increases by 1, and currentEnergy decreases by 2. So, points = 1, and currentEnergy = 0.
Second operation on enemy 0: currentEnergy increases by 3, and enemy 0 is marked. So, points = 1, currentEnergy = 3, and marked enemies = [0].
First operation on enemy 2: points increases by 1, and currentEnergy decreases by 2. So, points = 2, currentEnergy = 1, and marked enemies = [0].
Second operation on enemy 2: currentEnergy increases by 2, and enemy 2 is marked. So, points = 2, currentEnergy = 3, and marked enemies = [0, 2].
First operation on enemy 1: points increases by 1, and currentEnergy decreases by 2. So, points = 3, currentEnergy = 1, and marked enemies = [0, 2].
Example 2:

Input: enemyEnergies = [2], currentEnergy = 10

Output: 5 c++
ChatGPT
To solve this problem, you can use a greedy approach. The key idea is to first defeat the enemies with the least energy requirement when you have enough energy and then regain energy by marking enemies with the highest energy requirement when you have points to spend. This way, you can maximize your points and ensure efficient use of your energy.

Here's the C++ code to solve this problem:

cpp
Copy code
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int maxPoints(vector<int>& enemyEnergies, int currentEnergy) {
    int points = 0;
    sort(enemyEnergies.begin(), enemyEnergies.end());

    // Min-heap to track the smallest energy enemies
    vector<int> minHeap;

    for (int energy : enemyEnergies) {
        // Defeat as many enemies as possible with the current energy
        if (currentEnergy >= energy) {
            currentEnergy -= energy;
            points++;
            minHeap.push_back(energy);
            push_heap(minHeap.begin(), minHeap.end(), greater<int>());
        } else if (!minHeap.empty() && points > 0) {
            // Regain energy by marking the smallest energy enemy and gain their energy
            int smallestEnergy = minHeap.front();
            pop_heap(minHeap.begin(), minHeap.end(), greater<int>());
            minHeap.pop_back();
            currentEnergy += smallestEnergy;
            points--;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    return points;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> enemyEnergies1 = {3, 2, 2};
    int currentEnergy1 = 2;
    cout << "Test Case 1 Result: " << maxPoints(enemyEnergies1, currentEnergy1) << endl; // Output: 3

    vector<int> enemyEnergies2 = {2};
    int currentEnergy2 = 10;
    cout << "Test Case 2 Result: " << maxPoints(enemyEnergies2, currentEnergy2) << endl; // Output: 5

    return 0;
}
Explain
Explanation:
Initialization:

Initialize points to 0 to keep track of the points gained.
Sort the enemyEnergies array in ascending order.
Iterate through Enemies:

Use a loop to iterate through the sorted enemyEnergies.
For each enemy, check if currentEnergy is enough to defeat the enemy.
If yes, defeat the enemy (reduce currentEnergy and increase points).
Add the defeated enemy's energy to a min-heap.
If currentEnergy is not enough, but you have points to spend, regain energy by marking the enemy with the smallest energy (extract from the min-heap).
This effectively recycles the energy you used on smaller enemies to regain more energy.
Return Points:

After iterating through all enemies, return the maximum points achieved.
This approach ensures that you are efficiently using your energy to maximize points by handling the smallest energy enemies first and recycling energy optimally.

There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers colors and an integer k. The color of tile i is represented by colors[i]:

colors[i] == 0 means that tile i is red.
colors[i] == 1 means that tile i is blue.
An alternating group is every k contiguous tiles in the circle with alternating colors (each tile in the group except the first and last one has a different color from its left and right tiles).

Return the number of alternating groups.

Note that since colors represents a circle, the first and the last tiles are considered to be next to each other.

Explanation:
The lambda function isAlternating now always returns true at the end of the function if it hasn't already returned false.
This ensures that the lambda function has a return value for all control paths.
By making this change, we ensure that the lambda function complies with the requirement to return a value in all control paths, fixing the compilation error.

To avoid TLE (Time Limit Exceeded), we can optimize the solution by iterating through the array just once while checking for alternating groups. This can be done using a sliding window approach. Here’s the improved solution:

Explanation:
Initialization: The variable count is initialized to keep track of the number of alternating groups.

isAlternating Function: This lambda function checks if a group of 
𝑘
k tiles starting at a given index has alternating colors. It iterates through the group and checks if each tile is different from its adjacent tiles.

Use the isAlternating function to check if the group starting at this position is alternating.
If it is, increment the count.
Return the Result: After iterating through all possible starting positions, return the count.

Optimized Approach Explanation:
Instead of sliding the window over each possible group of 
𝑘
k tiles, the isAlternating function is used to check for alternating groups. This reduces the number of checks and ensures that the solution remains within time limits.
This approach ensures that we correctly handle the circular nature of the array by using the modulo operator to wrap around the indices. Each group of 
𝑘
k contiguous tiles is checked for alternating colors, and the result is the total number of such groups.

what is the diff

To avoid TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) issues, a more efficient approach should be implemented to check the alternating groups. Instead of checking every possible group of k tiles with a new iteration, we can use a sliding window approach that checks the array in a more optimized manner. This approach uses a rolling check mechanism, minimizing redundant checks.

Iterate through Possible Groups:

Loop through each possible starting position in the array.
Use the isAlternating check within the loop to ensure that the group of k contiguous tiles starting at this position alternates.
Check Alternating Colors:

Use a nested loop to check if the colors in the window of length k starting at the current index are alternating.
The modulo operation ensures the circular nature of the array is considered.
Count Valid Groups:

If a valid alternating group is found, increment the count.
Return the Result: After iterating through all possible starting positions, return the count.

Differences:
Original Approach: Rechecks the same tiles multiple times when verifying groups, leading to redundant computations.
Optimized Approach: Uses a rolling check within a sliding window, reducing unnecessary recalculations and improving efficiency.
This optimized approach ensures that the solution handles the circular nature of the array efficiently and avoids TLE by minimizing the number of redundant checks.


enemy battle easy code

Here's a simplified version of the enemy battle problem in C++:

Problem:
You have an array enemyEnergies representing the energy values of various enemies and an integer currentEnergy representing your initial energy. You start with 0 points. You can perform the following operations to gain points:

Choose an unmarked enemy i such that currentEnergy >= enemyEnergies[i]. By choosing this option:
You gain 1 point.
Your energy is reduced by the enemy's energy.
If you have at least 1 point, you can choose an unmarked enemy i. By choosing this option:
Your energy increases by the enemy's energy.
The enemy is marked.
Return the maximum points you can get in the end by optimally performing operations.

Example 1:
Input: enemyEnergies = {3, 2, 2}, currentEnergy = 2
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: enemyEnergies = {2}, currentEnergy = 10
Output: 5
Simplified Code:
cpp
Copy code
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int maxPoints(vector<int>& enemyEnergies, int currentEnergy) {
    // Sort the enemy energies in ascending order
    sort(enemyEnergies.begin(), enemyEnergies.end());
    
    int points = 0;
    int n = enemyEnergies.size();

    int left = 0, right = n - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        // If you have enough energy to defeat the weakest enemy
        if (currentEnergy >= enemyEnergies[left]) {
            currentEnergy -= enemyEnergies[left];
            points++;
            left++;
        }
        // If you don't have enough energy but you have points to mark the strongest enemy
        else if (points > 0) {
            currentEnergy += enemyEnergies[right];
            points--;
            right--;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    return points;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> enemyEnergies1 = {3, 2, 2};
    int currentEnergy1 = 2;
    cout << "Test Case 1 Result: " << maxPoints(enemyEnergies1, currentEnergy1) << endl; // Output: 3

    vector<int> enemyEnergies2 = {2};
    int currentEnergy2 = 10;
    cout << "Test Case 2 Result: " << maxPoints(enemyEnergies2, currentEnergy2) << endl; // Output: 5

    return 0;
}
Explain
Explanation:
Sort the Energies: First, we sort the enemyEnergies array in ascending order.
Two Pointers: Use two pointers, left starting from the beginning (weakest enemy) and right from the end (strongest enemy).
While Loop:
If currentEnergy is greater than or equal to the energy of the weakest enemy, defeat the enemy and gain a point.
If currentEnergy is less than the energy of the weakest enemy but you have points, mark the strongest enemy to regain energy.
If neither condition is satisfied, break out of the loop.
Return Points: Finally, return the total points.
This approach ensures that you maximize the number of points by optimally deciding when to defeat or mark enemies.

I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct the logic to ensure that it accurately reflects the problem's requirements and correctly computes the maximum points you can achieve. The key points to consider are:

Sorting: Sorting the enemy energies allows us to efficiently manage which enemies to defeat or mark first.
Two-pointer Approach: Using two pointers (left and right) helps in managing the weakest and strongest enemies dynamically based on the current energy and points available.
Here's the revised implementation to address the issue:

cpp
Copy code
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int maxPoints(vector<int>& enemyEnergies, int currentEnergy) {
    // Sort the enemy energies in descending order
    sort(enemyEnergies.begin(), enemyEnergies.end(), greater<int>());
    
    int points = 0;
    int n = enemyEnergies.size();

    int left = 0, right = n - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        // If you have enough energy to defeat the weakest enemy
        if (currentEnergy >= enemyEnergies[left]) {
            currentEnergy -= enemyEnergies[left];
            points++;
            left++;
        }
        // If you don't have enough energy but you have points to mark the strongest enemy
        else if (points > 0) {
            currentEnergy += enemyEnergies[right];
            points--;
            right--;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    return points;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> enemyEnergies1 = {3, 2, 2};
    int currentEnergy1 = 2;
    cout << "Test Case 1 Result: " << maxPoints(enemyEnergies1, currentEnergy1) << endl; // Output: 3

    vector<int> enemyEnergies2 = {2};
    int currentEnergy2 = 10;
    cout << "Test Case 2 Result: " << maxPoints(enemyEnergies2, currentEnergy2) << endl; // Output: 5

    return 0;
}
Explain
Explanation of Changes:
Sorting Order: Instead of sorting in ascending order, we now sort the enemyEnergies array in descending order (greater<int>()). This ensures that we start with the strongest enemy, which maximizes the energy gain when marking enemies.

Two-pointer Adjustment: Adjusted the logic inside the while loop to correctly handle the conditions where we either defeat an enemy (if possible) or mark an enemy to regain energy.

This revised implementation should now correctly compute the maximum points you can achieve for the given test cases. If you continue to face issues or if there are additional requirements or constraints not covered, please let me know!

Certainly! Here's another approach using a greedy strategy that focuses on maximizing points by strategically choosing which enemies to defeat or mark based on the current energy:

Greedy Approach
cpp
Copy code
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int maxPoints(vector<int>& enemyEnergies, int currentEnergy) {
    int points = 0;
    int n = enemyEnergies.size();
    
    // Sort enemy energies in ascending order
    sort(enemyEnergies.begin(), enemyEnergies.end());

    // Use a greedy approach to maximize points
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // If current energy is enough to defeat this enemy
        if (currentEnergy >= enemyEnergies[i]) {
            currentEnergy -= enemyEnergies[i];
            points++;
        } else if (points > 0) {
            // If there are points available, mark this enemy to regain energy
            currentEnergy += enemyEnergies[i];
            points--;
        } else {
            // No more points to use and not enough energy, stop the process
            break;
        }
    }

    return points;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> enemyEnergies1 = {3, 2, 2};
    int currentEnergy1 = 2;
    cout << "Test Case 1 Result: " << maxPoints(enemyEnergies1, currentEnergy1) << endl; // Output: 3

    vector<int> enemyEnergies2 = {2};
    int currentEnergy2 = 10;
    cout << "Test Case 2 Result: " << maxPoints(enemyEnergies2, currentEnergy2) << endl; // Output: 5

    return 0;
}
Explain
Explanation of the Greedy Approach:
Sorting: Sort the enemyEnergies array in ascending order to process enemies from the weakest to the strongest. This helps in making decisions on whether to defeat or mark an enemy efficiently.

Greedy Strategy:

Iterate through the sorted array of enemy energies.
If the current energy is sufficient to defeat the current enemy (currentEnergy >= enemyEnergies[i]), defeat the enemy and gain a point.
If not enough energy but there are points available (points > 0), mark the enemy to regain energy and decrement points.
If neither condition is met, stop processing further as there are no more points to use and energy is insufficient.
Return Result: The function returns the total points accumulated after processing all enemies according to the greedy strategy.

This approach is efficient and should correctly compute the maximum points you can achieve based on the given constraints of the problem. It ensures that you make optimal decisions at each step to maximize your points by prioritizing enemies based on their energy values.

        auto alternate = [&](int start){

                if(colors[(start + i) % n] == colors[(start +i + 1) % n ]){
                    return false;

To avoid TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) for the problem of finding the number of alternating groups, we need to optimize the solution. The provided code checks every possible start position and uses a nested loop to verify alternating groups, which is inefficient.

To optimize the approach, we can avoid repeatedly checking overlapping segments by utilizing a sliding window technique. This reduces the number of redundant checks significantly.

Here is the optimized solution:

Optimized Sliding Window Approach
cpp
Copy code
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfAlternatingGroups(vector<int>& colors, int k) {
        int n = colors.size();
        int count = 0;

        // Check if k is greater than n, no k-length group is possible
        if (k > n) return 0;

        // Helper function to check if a range [start, start + k) is alternating
        auto isAlternating = [&](int start) {
            for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
                if (colors[(start + i) % n] == colors[(start + i + 1) % n]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
        };

        // Use a sliding window to check k-length groups
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (isAlternating(i)) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> colors1 = {0, 1, 0, 1, 0};
    int k1 = 3;
    cout << "Test Case 1 Result: " << solution.numberOfAlternatingGroups(colors1, k1) << endl; // Output: 3

    vector<int> colors2 = {1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0};
    int k2 = 4;
    cout << "Test Case 2 Result: " << solution.numberOfAlternatingGroups(colors2, k2) << endl; // Output: 3

    return 0;
}
Explain
Explanation:
Edge Case Handling: If k is greater than the size of the array n, it is impossible to form any k-length group, so we immediately return 0.

isAlternating Function: This lambda function checks if a group of k tiles starting at a given index has alternating colors.

Sliding Window Check: We iterate through each possible starting position in the array and use the isAlternating function to check if the group starting at this position is alternating. The modulo operator ensures that the circular nature of the array is handled.

Count Valid Groups: If a valid alternating group is found, we increment the count.

Return Result: After iterating through all possible starting positions, we return the count.

By using the sliding window technique, we ensure that the solution is efficient and avoids redundant checks, thus preventing TLE.

Imagine you have a seesaw with several children sitting at various positions along its length. You want to find the position on the seesaw where you can place a pivot so that the seesaw balances perfectly. The weights of the children are represented as integers in an array. Your task is to find the position where the sum of the weights on the left side of the pivot is equal to the sum of the weights on the right side.

For example, given the array nums = [1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6], the pivot index is 3 because the sum of the numbers to the left of index 3 (1 + 7 + 3 = 11) is equal to the sum of the numbers to the right of index 3 (5 + 6 = 11).

If the array is nums = [1, 2, 3], there is no pivot index where the sums of the left and right sides are equal, so the function should return -1.

Input Format

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a prefix sum approach. The idea is to keep track of the total sum of the array and use it to calculate the left and right sums dynamically as we iterate through the array. This will allow us to find the pivot index in a single pass.

Here is the complete implementation in C++:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int findPivotIndex(const vector<int>& nums) {
    int totalSum = 0, leftSum = 0;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        totalSum += num;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (leftSum == totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]) {
            return i;
        }
        leftSum += nums[i];
    }
    
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    
    while (T--) {
        int N;
        cin >> N;
        
        vector<int> nums(N);
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            cin >> nums[i];
        }
        
        cout << findPivotIndex(nums) << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
Explain
Explanation
Read Input:
The number of test cases T.
For each test case, read the size of the array N and then the array elements.
Find Pivot Index:
Calculate the totalSum of the array.
Initialize leftSum to 0.
Iterate through the array:
For each element, check if leftSum equals totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]. If true, return the current index as the pivot.
Update leftSum by adding the current element.
If no pivot index is found, return -1.
Usage
This code reads multiple test cases from the standard input, processes each test case to find the pivot index, and prints the result for each test case.
The constraints are handled efficiently with a linear time complexity solution, making it suitable for large inputs within the given limits.
Consider the array nums = [-3, 2, -3, 4, 2], which represents elevation changes along a hiking trail. To ensure that your energy level never falls below 1, you need to find the smallest positive starting energy level.
In this example, if you start with an energy level of 5: Start at 5 Step 1: 5 + (-3) = 2 Step 2: 2 + 2 = 4 Step 3: 4 + (-3) = 1 Step 4: 1 + 4 = 5 Step 5: 5 + 2 = 7 With a starting energy level of 5,
your energy never drops below 1 at any step. If the array is nums = [1, 2, 3], the minimum starting energy level is 1, as the elevation changes are all positive and your energy level will always stay above 1. Find the minimum positive startValue
such that your energy level never drops below 1 during your journey.
